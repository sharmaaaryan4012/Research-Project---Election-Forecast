# Election Forecast Model 2016 - Research Project

This repository houses a research project aimed at understanding and extending the Economist's election forecast model from the 2016 United States presidential election. The project is rooted in the implementation of a dynamic multilevel Bayesian model, originally written in R and Stan.

### Project Overview

The foundation of this project is based on the innovative work conducted by The Economist, which you can explore through their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheEconomist/us-potus-model). Their model, improving on Pierre Kremp’s adaptation of Drew Linzer’s dynamic linear model for election forecasting (Linzer 2013), integrates corrections for various biases and employs state-level priors and empirical correlations to provide accurate and insightful election predictions.

In this repository, we delve deeper into the model, specifically focusing on the 2016 US presidential elections, with an aim to:

1. Enhance understanding of the model's underlying mechanics and methodologies.
2. Experiment with and assess the model’s predictive performance.
3. Introduce new evaluation metrics, namely Brier Scores, to gauge the model's accuracy in two distinct approaches:
   - Single State Predictions
   - Conditional Probability (Two-State Scenario)

### Repository Structure

- **Scripts/Model Directory**: Here, you will find the crucial R scripts tailored for the 2008, 2012, and 2016 US presidential elections. These scripts are instrumental in importing data, running the model, and parsing results. Specifically, the `final_model_2016.R` script has been modified for this project’s objectives.

- **Stan Scripts**: These scripts run different versions of the polling aggregate and election forecasting model, providing a comprehensive view of the election landscape.

- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations and insights into the workings of the model, drawing parallels and highlighting differences from the original Economist’s model.

### Getting Started

To dive into this research project, start by cloning this repository and navigating through the script and Stan script directories. The modifications made to `final_model_2016.R` are clearly commented for easy understanding and replication.

### Acknowledgements

This project stands on the shoulders of the pioneering work done by The Economist. We express our utmost gratitude and respect for their open-source contributions, which have enabled a wider audience to engage with and learn from their sophisticated modeling techniques.
